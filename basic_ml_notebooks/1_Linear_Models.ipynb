    "#### **Simple Linear Regression**\n",
    "* The predictor/independent variable (X)\n",
    "* The response/dependent variable (that we want to predict)(Y)\n",
    "* $$y_i=\\beta x_i+\\alpha+\\varepsilon_i$$\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### **Multiple Linear Regression**\n",
    "* multiple predictor (independent) variable predictions\n",
    "* $$y_i=\\alpha+\\beta_i x_{i1}+\\dots+\\beta_k x_{ik}+\\varepsilon_i$$\n",
    "* **Evaluation**: *distribution plot*\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Residual Plot**\n",
    "* Difference between $y_i$ and $\\hat{y_i}$.\n",
    "* Random spreaded out residuals $\\Longrightarrow$ *constant variance* $\\Longrightarrow$ **good** fit\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Evaluation**\n",
    "* **$R^2$**\n",
    "* **Mean Squared Error** (MSE): cost function of linear regression model\n",
    "    * $$MSE(X, h_\\theta)=\\frac1{m}\\sum_{i=0}^m(\\theta^T\\cdot{x^i} - y^i)^2$$\n",
    "    * **Normal Equation** $$\\hat{\\theta} = (X^T\\cdot{X}^{-1})\\cdot{X^T}\\cdot{y}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Regularization**\n",
    "* **Ridge regression**\n",
    "    * Adding $\\alpha\\sum_{i=1}^n\\theta_i^2$ to the cost function $\\Longrightarrow$ weights $\\downarrow$\n",
    "    * **Ridge Regression cost function**:\n",
    "        * $$J(\\theta) = MSE(\\theta) + \\alpha\\frac1{2}\\sum_{i=1}^n\\theta_i^2$$\n",
    "        * $$J(\\theta) = \\frac1{m}\\sum_{i=1}^m(\\theta^T\\cdot{X^i} - y^i)^2 + \\alpha\\frac1{2}\\sum_{i=1}^n\\theta_i^2$$\n",
    "    * ***$\\alpha$*** regularize the model\n",
    "        * $\\alpha$ = 0 $\\Longrightarrow$ Linear Regression Model\n",
    "        * $\\alpha$ $\\uparrow$: weights $\\Longrightarrow$ 0 $\\Longrightarrow$ fitting line: a horizontal line close to mean\n",
    "    * **Only** added to the cost function during the training; removed for evaluating the model's performance\n",
    "    * **Important Notes**\n",
    "        * the bias term $\\theta_0$ is not regularized because the sum starts at i = 1;\n",
    "        * if $ w = [\\theta_1, \\theta_2, ...., \\theta_n]$, the regularization term is simply equal to $\\frac1{2}(\\|w\\|_2)^2$, where $\\|\\cdot\\|_2$ represents the norm of the weight vector.\n",
    "        * it is really important to scale the data (e.g., using StanadardScalar), because the Ridge Regression model is sensitive to the scales of the input features.\n",
    "    * **Two types**\n",
    "        * **Closed-form Equation**: $$\\hat{\\theta} = (X^T\\cdot{X} + \\alpha A)^{-1}\\cdot{X^T}\\cdot{y}$$\n",
    "        * **Gradient Descent**: $\\ell_2$ $\\Longrightarrow$ $J(\\theta)$ == half the squred of the $\\ell_2$ norm of the weight vector\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Lasso regression (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator Regression)**\n",
    "    * $\\ell_1$ norm of the weight vector\n",
    "    * cost function: $$J(\\theta) = MSE(\\theta) + \\alpha \\sum_{i=1}^n |\\theta_i|$$\n",
    "    * the weights of the least important features $\\Longrightarrow$ 0\n",
    "        * automatically performs the feature selection $\\Longrightarrow$ a **'sparse model'** output\n",
    "    * **Need to gradually reduce the learning rate $\\Longrightarrow$ the global minimum**\n",
    "* **Elastic Net**\n",
    "    * a middle ground between the Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression\n",
    "    * cost function: $$J(\\theta)=MSE(\\theta)+r\\alpha\\sum_{i=1}^n|\\theta|+\\frac{1-r}{2}\\alpha\\sum_{i=1}^n\\theta_i^2$$\n",
    "* **Conclusive suggestions** \n",
    "    * **no** purely Linear Regression\n",
    "    * **add** some regularization\n",
